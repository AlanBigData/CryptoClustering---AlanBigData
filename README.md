# CryptoClustering Price Change Prediction with Unsupervised Learning

This repository contains Python code for predicting whether cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes using unsupervised learning techniques. The project utilizes K-means clustering algorithm to group cryptocurrencies based on their price change behaviors.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical price data of various cryptocurrencies. It includes attributes such as the cryptocurrency name, symbol, price changes over 24 hours and 7 days, market capitalization, trading volume, etc.

## Files
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset files.
- `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the main code for the project.
